You have a Google Ad campaign with a high CPA and you're desperate to find ways to lower it. You can't sustain this high CPA forever and if you don't figure something out you're going to blow throw your ad budget quickly.

_What's a PPC advertiser to do?_

One way you can lower your CPA is through location bid modifiers or location level bid adjustments. Whatever you want to call it.

It involves identifying which locations are driving up your ad spend without producing many conversions. Once you've identified the poor-performing locations, you can either add a negative bid adjustment or exclude the location completely.

**Important**: This tip is assuming you set up your location targeting in a granular fashion when first setting up your campaign.

_What does this mean?_

For example, if your goal was to target the entire USA with your ad, instead of just setting your location targeting to "USA", you'd want to list each of the 50 states. This way you can easily sort the data by the highest cost per conversion and apply your negative bid adjustments accordingly.

Here's what that would look like:
