Clickfunnels is a popular tool these days for those looking for a simple way to create an online sales funnel. You may be wondering if it makes sense to use Clickfunnels for a membership site.Clickfunnels does offer a 'membership funnel' to accept registration, payments and allow for access to a password protected members area.

I personally haven't used Clickfunnels yet to manage a membership site, so I can't give a full list of pros and cons, nor can I give you a definitive answer on whether or not you should use Clickfunnels for your membership site.

I've only used it for building out some funnels for certain clients who have bought into Clickfunnels.

All I can say is that there are much, much cheaper options out there these days and it's unlikely Clickfunnels is bringing much more value to the table here compared to the alternatives so the additional expense is not justified in my opinion.What are these other options?
