  I got a new email address from Hey.com recently and I tried using it as my
  'sending' email address in Convertkit (aff link).After a few broadcasts, I
  started to notice that my open rates took a huge nosedive. They went from
  20-30% to about 5%. After digging around, I read this article by Convertkit
  saying how important it is to send from a custom domain. Duh! That makes
  sense.

I got a new email address from Hey.com recently and I tried using it as my 'sending' email address in Convertkit ([aff link](https://convertkit.com/?lmref=nx-ezw&ref=freak.marketing)).After a few broadcasts, I started to notice that my open rates took a huge nosedive. They went from 20-30% to about 5%. After digging around, I read [this article](https://help.convertkit.com/en/articles/2502558-using-a-verified-domain-for-email-sending?ref=freak.marketing) by Convertkit saying how important it is to send from a custom domain.

Duh! That makes sense.

Since Hey.com doesn't have custom domains yet I paid for the pro plan at Protonmail to set an email address with a custom domain. I verified it with Convertkit by adding a TX hosting record.The next broadcast email I sent out was back up near 30% so it seemed to have done the trick. Try it out if you're not already sending from a custom domain.
