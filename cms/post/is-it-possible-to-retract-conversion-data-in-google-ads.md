  Somehow your conversion tracking wasn't set up properly and you ended up with
  a bunch of false conversion data in your Google Ad Campaign. Obviously, you
  don't want Google Ad's smart bidding algorithm to use that data for optimizing
  the campaign.So is there a way to delete the data?

Somehow your conversion tracking wasn't set up properly and you ended up with a bunch of false conversion data in your Google Ad Campaign. Obviously, you don't want Google Ad's smart bidding algorithm to use that data for optimizing the campaign.

_So is there a way to delete the data?_

In a way yes, you can use [Google Ad's Data Exclusions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10276486?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing) so the conversion data is not used for Google's smart bidding algorithm.

Simply set the start date and end date for the data exclusion and you're all set!
