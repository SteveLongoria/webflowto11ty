If you're not careful, it's easy to waste a lot of ads spend on 'junk' search queries in your Google Ad Search Campaign. That is, search queries or search terms that aren't relevant to your product or service.

It's important [review your 'search terms' report](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7531771?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing) and add these junk search terms as ['negative keywords'](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453972?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing).

I'll typically use 'phrase match' keyword match type for negative keywords since I feel like it's a bit more precise.

Using broad match as negative keywords might end up blocking too many search queries.

When you're adding negative keywords, try brainstorming and adding additional keywords that are similar to the ones you're adding as negative keywords.

This will help you to be a bit more preemptive and hopefully prevent you from receiving more junk search queries in the future.

If this still doesn't work, try drastically lowering your bids for broad match and broad match modifier keywords or try removing them all together and focus just on phrase match and exact match keywords.
