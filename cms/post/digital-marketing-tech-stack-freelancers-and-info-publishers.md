There's a million different website builders, funnel builders, email marketing softwares, CRMs, CMS', payment plugins, portals, form builders, etc.

It can be quite daunting when figuring out which tools to use for your website and digital marketing campaigns.

I'm currently using the following and highly recommend them:

1\. Carrd
---------

I currently use this for [SteveLongoria.net](https://stevelongoria.net). I switched from [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/4623107), which is also a great website builder for more complex websites.

Carrd is a great single-page website builder with a built-in form builder. You can create multiple pages but it's not well suited for big websites with a lot of pages and a navigation bar. It's perfect for sales pages, profile pages, squeeze pages, etc.

You can even set up Stripe checkout to handle payments for any digital product or service you want to sell. With their pricing plan you get build up to 25 single page websites or landing pages for only $49/year:

2\. [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/4623107)
----------------------------------------------

Even though I switched to Carrd for SteveLongoria.net, I still use Webflow ([aff link](https://webflow.grsm.io/4623107)) for a lot of client sites. It's still my 'go to' for anything Carrd can't handle easily. It gives you the ability to make more customized designs.

It's a great solution for creating membership sites when combining it with [Memberstack](https://memberstack.com). Or if you want a multi-page website with navigation, Webflow is just the ticket.

3\. Stripe
----------

When it comes to taking payments on your website, nothing really compares to Stripe in my opinion. Sure you could use PayPal but I personally haven't used PayPal for several years and remember having trouble making beautiful checkouts. With Stripe Checkout it's really easy to create beautiful checkouts that include Apple Pay or Google Pay.

4\. Convertkit
--------------

I'm using this for my email marketing automations. For now, my needs here are pretty basic. I simply have a newsletter optin and have members of my blog synced to Convertkit using Zapier.com.

I plan on setting up more complex marketing automations with Convertkit as my list continues to grow.

5\. Ghost blog
--------------

I was using Hexo blog for the past couple of years which is a great static site generator but a lot has changed in that time. I've been doing less and less coding work and have found myself wanting something that doesn't involve terminal commands and markdown.

I wanted a slick CMS and a more user-friendly editor. I also wanted something that was search engine optimized out of the box. For these reasons, I made the switch to Ghost.

Other Solutions I'm Considering
-------------------------------

Right now I only sell freelance services and don't have any products to offer at the moment. So my needs are fairly simple. I just need a way to publish content, rank it in the search engines, and generate leads.

I plan on launching ebooks and courses in the near future and when I do I may end up choosing [Podia](https://podia.com) to handle payments and product delivery.

It's not 100% necessary since you can technically set up any sales page and Stripe checkout button using Carrd but Podia makes it easier to manage your products and courses since they're all in one place.

Customers have a password protected members area they can go to access any products or e-courses they buy. Podia comes with some extra nifty features too like one-click upsells and the ability to easily bundle products together and offer special offers.

I'm also considering [RightMessage](https://rightmessage.com) in the future to help add more personalization to my marketing funnels. The general idea is that everyone has a different reason to care about your products or services. The more you can segment your email list and personalize the content to match their specific situation, the easier it is to sell them.
