  Maximize Conversions can be a great bid strategy to use for your Google Ads
  Campaign. Recently Google Ads combined their Target CPA bid strategy and
  Maximize Conversions bid strategy together. Target CPA is now simply an addon
  option you can use set now when using Maximize Conversions bid strategy.So
  should you set a Target CPA or just let Maximize Conversions 'do its
  thang'.There's never a definite answer to this question and you should always
  perform a Google Experiment to test for yourself. This way, if setting a
  Target CPA actually causes your campaign to perform worse, you can easily
  revert back to your original campaign by canceling the Experiment. No harm no
  foul.

Maximize Conversions can be a great bid strategy to use for your Google Ads Campaign. Recently Google Ads combined their Target CPA bid strategy and Maximize Conversions bid strategy together. Target CPA is now simply an addon option you can use set now when using Maximize Conversions bid strategy.

So should you set a Target CPA or just let Maximize Conversions 'do its thang'.

There's never a definite answer to this question and you should always perform a Google Experiment to test for yourself. This way, if setting a Target CPA actually causes your campaign to perform worse, you can easily revert back to your original campaign by canceling the Experiment. No harm no foul.

For myself, I typically will just use Maximize Conversion bid strategy without the Target CPA set, then I simply review performance across multiple dimensions to make any necessary adjustments I see that will lower our cost per conversion.

For example, let's say that for ages 18-24 we're just driving up cost without seeing any conversions, you can exclude that age group from the campaign so you no longer receive clicks from them. Lowering your cost per conversion on the campaign is largely a matter of reducing wasted ad spend.
