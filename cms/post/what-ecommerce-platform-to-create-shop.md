  You've decided to finally take the leap and start selling your products online
  via your OWN shop, not some 3rd party marketplace like Amazon or Etsy.There's
  just one problem, you're not sure which platform to build your ecommerce shop
  with. There are quite a few options to choose from these days; Shopify,
  Woocommerce, Webflow, SquareSpace, Wix, etc.Shopify is the king these days,
  but it has some cons. Unless you know liquid templating, html and CSS, it's
  going to be difficult for you to make design changes to your own website. If
  you can find a template that won't require you to make any adjustments to the
  design, then it might be a good fit.

You've decided to finally take the leap and start selling your products online via your OWN shop, not some 3rd party marketplace like Amazon or Etsy.

There's just one problem, you're not sure which platform to build your ecommerce shop with. There are quite a few options to choose from these days; Shopify, Woocommerce, [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/4623107?ref=freak.marketing), SquareSpace, Wix, etc.

Shopify is the king these days, but it has some cons. Unless you know liquid templating, html and CSS, it's going to be difficult for you to make design changes to your own website. If you can find a template that won't require you to make any adjustments to the design, then it might be a good fit.

It also integrates with most shipping software, which can also be a factor in choosing which platform you want to use.

[Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/4623107?ref=freak.marketing) for example, while it has a great 'no-code' designer that allows you to make changes to your design without knowing ANY code, it doesn't integrate with PirateShip yet which is a very popular solutions when it comes to ecommerce shipping.

Woocommerce is an OK choice but that means working with Wordpress, which I personally hate. You also run into similar problems as you do with Shopify, if you don't know code it'll be very difficult for you to make design revisions to your website.

I can't speak much for SquareSpace or Wix as eCommerce platforms other than that, in general, I prefer SquareSpace over Wix. With that said, Webflow is my favorite 'no-code' web design platform/tool and if you're okay with the shipping software it integrates with, I recommend just going with Webflow as it has way more options for customization and has a better Designer.
