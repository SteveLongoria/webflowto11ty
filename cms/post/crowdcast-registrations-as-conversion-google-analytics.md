When creating your live webinar, the clear choice for many people is Crowdcast. It has a lot of amazing features that make webinar creation and management a breeze.

The problem is, it's not easy to track webinar event registrations as a conversion in Google Analytics or Google Ads. This is because it doesn't have a Google Analytics integration. If it did, you'd also probably need to set up cross-domain tracking as well, which can be tricky.

So how are you supposed to track Crowdcast event registrations as a conversion?

Create a webinar sign up page on your website using either a [Drip](https://drip.com/?ref=freak.marketing) or [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/?ref=freak.marketing) ([affiliate link](https://convertkit.com/?lmref=nx-ezw&ref=freak.marketing)) form. Since the form is on your site it's easy to set up conversion tracking for it.

Then [use this Zapier zap](https://zapier.com/apps/crowdcast/integrations/google-analytics?ref=freak.marketing) to register people for you Crowdcast event:

If it's a paid Crowdcast webinar you'd need to do the same thing but with [a Stripe form embedded on your site for taking payments](https://freak.marketing/embed-stripe-payment-form-on-your-website/). Then just make sure the customer is being added to your Convertkit list with the right tag so it triggers the Convertkit > Crowdcast zap referenced above.

If you have Wordpress, you can use a plugin like Gravity Forms to create your Stripe Payments Form on your site.
