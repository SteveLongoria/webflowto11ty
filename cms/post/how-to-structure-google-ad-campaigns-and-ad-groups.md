  When creating your first Google Ad Campaign, you have to make a lot of
  decisions. One of the biggest decisions you have to make is how you're going
  to structure your campaigns and ad groups.If you just have one product or
  service you're trying to push. It's going to be fairly simple. One campaign
  with single-themed ad groups (STAGs), should suffice.Wait, what are STAG's?
  You've probably heard of SKAGs (single keyword ad groups) but this is too
  extreme IMO and just creates more work. Instead, I use the STAG (single themed
  ad group) approach with all of my campaigns, grouping similar keywords
  together in an ad group.

When creating your first Google Ad Campaign, you have to make a lot of decisions. One of the biggest decisions you have to make is how you're going to structure your campaigns and ad groups.

If you just have one product or service you're trying to push. It's going to be fairly simple. One campaign with single-themed ad groups (STAGs), should suffice.

Wait, what are STAG's? You've probably heard of SKAGs (single keyword ad groups) but this is too extreme IMO and just creates more work. Instead, I use the STAG (single themed ad group) approach with all of my campaigns, grouping similar keywords together in an ad group.

What if your business offers many services and products that target a different set of keywords?

Do you keep it all in one ad group, one campaign?

Do you break them up into separate ad groups?

Do you create a campaign for each service?

If you're looking for a campaign that's easy to manage, because you have limited time, I'd consider just breaking them all up into separate ad groups, but keeping them under one campaign, assuming you're trying to target the same location for all.

That's the bare minimum to get decent results IMO. If you're wanting the best results in many cases it actually does make sense to create separate campaigns for each product/service.

This is because you can have more control on the budget for each and since each service probably has a different customer lifetime value and sales conversion rate for the client, each campaign's target cost per conversion will be different.

Having the campaigns separate makes it easier to optimize for the target cost per conversion in that campaign.
