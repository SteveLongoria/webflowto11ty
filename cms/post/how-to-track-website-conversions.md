You have a spiffy new website for your business and you're ready to start leveraging this beautiful asset to generate more leads and sales for your business! You're ready to start diving into the diverse world of PPC advertising. You're excited to start generating a bunch of new business and all will be right in the world.

_Not so fast!_

It's rare that a PPC ad campaign is profitable right when you press the start button. This means that unless you have a way to improve the performance of your campaign overtime, you may never have a profitable campaign.

That's where conversion tracking comes in. Once you're able to track website conversions, you'll be able to see which ads, which keywords, which locations and which demographics are driving the best results.

Armed with this knowledge, it's easy to make the necessary adjustments in your PPC ad campaign to reduce wasted ad spend and increase your return on ad spend. Without website conversion tracking, you're essentially driving in the dark, which makes it very difficult to maximize your campaign's return on ad spend.

Great, you know now you want to track website conversions, but how?

The easiest way to set up website conversion tracking is using Google Tag Manager. You'll be able to [track form submissions](https://freak.marketing/track-form-submissions-as-conversions-without-thank-you-page/) as a conversion and [button clicks](https://freak.marketing/track-button-clicks-using-google-tag-manager-google-analytics-4-ga4/), [calls](https://freak.marketing/click-to-call-and-manually-dialed-calls-conversions-google-ads/), etc.

For some things like booking widgets and chat widgets, you'll need to review the app's documentation to see how they integrate with Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics or Google Ads. In most cases, they integrate with Google Analytics and send events to Google Analytics that you can then use to track conversions.
