You have a website with an embedded Calendly widget so visitors can schedule a  call with you, now you want to start driving traffic to your website via TikTok ads to get more people to schedule a call with you.

The problem is, in order to know which TikTok ads are driving performance you need to set up TikTok conversion tracking. Without it, you're just driving blind and you're not sure which ad creatives are generating the best results.

Unfortunately, Calendly doesn't have native integration with TikTok's tracking pixel as it does for Facebook and Google.

There are a couple of ways to get around this.

Method #1
---------

You can [set up Calendly conversion tracking with Google Analytics](https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001575393-Getting-started-with-Google-Analytics?ref=freak.marketing#supported-property-types-0-2), and then add UTM parameters to each TikTok ad. Then you'll know which TikTok Ad/Campaign is generating the best results inside Google Analytics.

How do you create UTM parameters for your TikTok Ads? Here's a [nifty Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDl9GdpuWB9kzXzWxKj3NYt392T6l6Tq9e89Yieg8AM/edit?ref=freak.marketing#gid=0) that helps you to create URLs with UTM parameters for your ad campaigns.

To be able to use it, you have to make a copy of it in Google Sheets:

Method #2
---------

Have your Calendly redirect users to an unique 'thank you' page URL on your website. Then you can use [Google Tag Manager to install the TikTok pixel](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000357&ref=freak.marketing) on your site and set up conversion tracking based on the 'thank you' page URL.

This method requires you to use Google Tag Manager which has it's own learning curve.
