If you're setting up a Google Ad Campaign for a Woocommerce Website, then one of the first things you'll want to setup is ecommerce sales conversion tracking so you know which Google Ad keywords and which dimensions are generating the most sales.

There are a few ways to do this but here's what I've found to be the easiest way to set this up.

1.  First you want to set up ecommerce sales conversion tracking in Google Analytics using a plugin like this one:

2\. Then you'll want to toggle on the Ecommerce settings in Google Analytics.

You should now start seeing sales data in Google Analytics:

3\. Connect your Google Ads and Google Analytics accounts together following the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033961?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing#zippy=%2Cin-this-article). This is so we can import the 'Transactions' conversion goal from Google Analytics into Google Ads using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1034306?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing). It may take 24 hours for the Goal to show up in Google Ads after you initially link your Google Ads and Google Analytics accounts together.
