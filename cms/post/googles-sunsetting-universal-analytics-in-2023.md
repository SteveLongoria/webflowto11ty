[Google confirmed recently what a lot of us have been expecting; they're sunsetting Universal Analytics on July 1st, 2023](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing). This means everyone currently using Universal Analytics will have to either switch to Google Analytics 4 or some other web analytics product.

A lot of folks in the marketing and advertising world are very upset by this. You can see from the comments in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tg2g91/google_sunsetting_universal_analytics_in_2023/?ref=freak.marketing) and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/tflign/gas_universal_analytics_will_stop_collecting_new/?ref=freak.marketing). To them, there was nothing wrong with Universal Analytics and GA4 is a huge step backward.

Many speculate that Google's being forced to do this since they're getting a lot of heat from the EU about user privacy. GA4 is supposed to be more privacy-focused and I believe Google is hoping that'll appease the EU regulators.

Whether it does or not still has yet to be seen.  

Another gripe is how Google is handling this transition. [They're not letting users import their historical data from Universal Analytics into GA4](https://usefathom.com/blog/google-analytics-importer?ref=freak.marketing), which I must admit, is not great.

Fortunately, there are some 3rd party analytics products like [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/?ref=freak.marketing) that are accommodating these users and allowing them to easily import their UA historical data into their analytics product.

What am I going to do? I'm not sure yet! I tend to agree with [this commenter's assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tg2g91/comment/i138u98/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I'm not seeing how this is that big a deal if your focus is on conversions, which is where the focus should be. Fewer vanity metrics are a good thing IMO.

Since I manage Google Ad Campaigns that target the USA and I myself reside in the USA, I haven't worried too much about Google's issues with the EU and GDPR.  With that said, I may consider trying out [PanelBear](https://panelbear.com/?ref=freak.marketing) since they have a great free tier or I might set up Fathom on a Digital Ocean Droplet.

**Note**: I'm not a lawyer and so this is not legal advice.
