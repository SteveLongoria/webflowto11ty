  You have a Google Ad campaign set up driving calls to your place of business
  and it's great that you're able to track call conversions in your campaign,
  but there's just one problem. You're only tracking call conversions and you
  have no clue how many of these calls are leading to appointments being
  scheduled.Not having this data makes it difficult to know where to allocate

You have a Google Ad campaign set up driving calls to your place of business and it's great that you're able to track call conversions in your campaign, but there's just one problem. You're only tracking call conversions and you have no clue how many of these calls are leading to appointments being scheduled.

Not having this data makes it difficult to know where to allocate your marketing budget for maximum profitability.

_So what's the best way to get this data?_

You'll want to set up what Google calls '[Offline Conversion Tracking](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2998031?hl=en&ref=freak.marketing)'. This essentially syncs your sales CRM data with your Google Ad campaign. It will allow you to see how many appointments are being booked from your Google Ad campaign AND which keywords and ads are generating more appointments.

You'll want to assign your appointment booked conversion goal a value and keep track in your sales CRM which calls lead to an appointment.

You then sync this data with your Google Ad campaign and you'll start to see which keywords and which ads are generating more appointments.

You could take this offline conversion tracking even further and track complete sales instead of just appointments booked, which would be my recommendation.

This would let you know which keywords and which ads in your Google Ad campaign are generating the best cost per sale, which is the best data you can get for optimizing your campaign.
