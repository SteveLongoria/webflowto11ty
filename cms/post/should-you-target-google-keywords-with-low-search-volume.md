Keywords are at the heart of every Google Search Ads Campaign. You have to make a lot of decisions surrounding keyword selection when setting up and managing a Google Ad Campaign.

One on the first questions is, "_Should I target long-tail keywords with low search volume or only high search volume keywords_?"

"_What match type should you use? Is Broad Match only going to waste your money?_"

Everyone has their own strategy when it comes to keywords. I can really only tell you what has worked well for me.

When I setup a Google Ad Campaign, I don't worry about search volume, only relevancy. I believe so long as a keyword is relevant, you should target it. This way you'll be able to track performance for that keyword more easily and make adjustments based on the performance.  
  
If I find I'm not getting enough search volume after the initial setup and keyword selection, then I look into adding more keywords.

I don't set out to add every possible relevant keyword from day 1 when starting my Google Ad Campaign.  
  
Keyword management is what I consider ongoing work. Every week, you add some keywords you might not be targeting yet and you add some negative keywords that you don't want to get clicks from anymore.
