  I recently published about the success I had using Google Shopping Ads with an
  eCommerce client of mine. Running Google Shopping Ads for an eCommerce shop
  should be a no-brainer at this point but some have asked me if it's better
  than running a normal Google Search Ad campaign.From my experience, it's worth
  running both Shopping Ads and your normal Search Ads to see which performs
  better or to just maximize sales by having your ads take up more screen real
  estate on the Google search results page.

I recently published about [the success I had using Google Shopping Ads](https://freak.marketing/post/google-shopping-ad-case-study-752-percent-return-on-ad-spend/) with an eCommerce client of mine. Running Google Shopping Ads for an eCommerce shop should be a no-brainer at this point but some have asked me if it's better than running a normal Google Search Ad campaign.

From my experience, it's worth running both Shopping Ads and your normal Search Ads to see which performs better or to just maximize sales by having your ads take up more screen real estate on the Google search results page.

I've seen both situations where the Shopping Ad Campaign would outperform the Search Ads for the same product but I've also seen the reverse; Search Ads outperforming the Shopping Ads.

Ultimately, you have much more control over a Search Ad campaign. How so? You can run Experiments to test different settings for starters. You also have more control over the keywords you get to target with the camapign.

Test them both out and see what kind of results you get. Honestly, even if one is performing better than the other, so long as they're both profitable, it's worth keeping them both running as you're likely to generate more total sales volume due to your ads taking up more screen real estate in the Google SERPs.
