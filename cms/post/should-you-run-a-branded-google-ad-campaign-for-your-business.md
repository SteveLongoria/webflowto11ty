When people search for your business name on Google. Should you have your ads show up or not? That is the question we'll address in this blog post.If your website doesn't show up in the top of the search results for your business name, then you should definitely run a branded Google Ad campaign for your business name.Maybe that's stating the obvious but you never know.

What if your website already shows up at the top of the Google search results page for your business name?I would still run a branded Google Ad Campaign. Why? Because often times your competitors are running Google Ads under your business name and you want to make it as easy as possible for your customers, and potential customers, to find you when they're actively searching for you.

The last thing you want is them getting frustrated when they're looking for your site and have them possibly do business with a competitor instead.So there you have it, if you're running Google Ads you should definitely target your business or brand name.
