  Google Ads made RSA the main and only ad type you can create now for Google
  Search Ad Campaigns. RIP Expanded Text Ads, you had a great run! I actually
  still have some Extended Text Ads running in some campaigns, Google just
  doesn't let you create new Extended Text Ads.I'm getting off track though, in
  this blog post we're going to talk about how many RSA's you should have in one
  ad group.RSA's are interesting in that you just add a bunch of headlines and
  when Google serves your ad they'll pick just 2-3 of them to serve. Overtime
  Google learns which headline and description combo generates the most clicks
  or conversions.

Google Ads made RSA the main and only ad type you can create now for Google Search Ad Campaigns. RIP Expanded Text Ads, you had a great run! I actually still have some Extended Text Ads running in some campaigns, Google just doesn't let you create new Extended Text Ads.

I'm getting off track though, in this blog post we're going to talk about how many RSA's you should have in one ad group.

RSA's are interesting in that you just add a bunch of headlines and when Google serves your ad they'll pick just 2-3 of them to serve. Overtime Google learns which headline and description combo generates the most clicks or conversions.

You can also pin headlines or descriptions to ensure they always show up in your ad copy.

So is there any situation where it would make sense to have more than on RSA in an ad group?

Absolutely! A great way to go about it is to have 2 ads in one ad group with slightly different themes. For example, let's say you have an ad group advertising food catering services, you could have 2 different RSA's with each highlighting a different style of cuisine your catering service provides. This way you'll be able to see overtime which cuisine resonates most with people searching for catering services in your area.
